chromophobe
===========

this is an R package to assist in choosing sane segmentation models, such as 
those produced by ChromHMM ( http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/ ). 

chromophobe includes a copy of ChromHMM, which is now also on GitHub:
https://github.com/jernst98/ChromHMM/

Eventually, the goal is to manage the whole pipeline in parallel via rJava. 

NEW NEWS!
=========

ChromHMM itself is now on GitHub at https://github.com/jernst98/ChromHMM/

You probably want to watch/star that repository too, if you're using this one.
