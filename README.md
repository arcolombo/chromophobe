chRomHMM
========

this is a rudimentary R package to handle cell-type and global enrichment plots,
for segmentations produced by ChromHMM ( http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/ )

perhaps one day it will also run the whole pipeline in parallel via rJava. 
but, don't hold your breath.  enrichment plots are enough for now.
