chromophobe
===========

this is a rudimentary R package to handle cell-type and global enrichment plots,
for segmentations produced by ChromHMM ( http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/ )

perhaps one day it will also run the whole pipeline in parallel via rJava. 
but, don't hold your breath.  enrichment plots are it for now.

NEW NEWS!
=========

chromophobe now includes the source to ChromHMM, which is now also on GitHub:
https://github.com/jernst98/ChromHMM/

You probably want to watch/star that repository too, if you're using this one.
