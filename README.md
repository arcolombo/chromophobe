chRomHMM
========

this is a rudimentary R package to handle cell-type and global enrichment plots,
for segmentations produced by ChromHMM (http://http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/)

perhaps one day it will also run the whole pipeline in parallel via rJava. 
but, don't hold your breath on that one.  enrichments are good for now.
